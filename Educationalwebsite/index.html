            <h2>What is Child Abuse?</h2>
            <p>Child abuse is defined as any action that causes significant harm to a child. This can occur in various forms, including physical, emotional, sexual, and neglectful behaviors. Understanding child abuse is crucial for everyone—children, teens, and adults—to help protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
            <p>Abuse can manifest in many ways, and recognizing its signs is essential for prevention. It may occur in a variety of environments: at home, in schools, or within the community. It's important to foster open conversations about safety and well-being in families, schools, and communities.</p>
            <p>Child abuse is a serious issue that affects millions of children worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1 in 4 adults report having been physically abused as children, which highlights the need for increased awareness and preventive measures.</p>
